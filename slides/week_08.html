# What is Supervised Learning?
- Supervised Learning is all about learning from examples.
- The basic idea is to identify meaningful patterns assoicated with some target label or value.
- Then use these patterns to create a mapping function that is able to map unseen data to the trained value or label.

-VV-
# Two common procedures
| | Classification |	Regression|
|:--|:--|:--|
| dependent variables | categorical	| continuous|
| Output | predicted Class |	predicted value |
| Performance |	Accuracy |	Deviation| 

-VV-
# Classification and Regression
- In machine learning, both classification and regression are almost always static models. 
- In static models a distinction exists between two indpendnet stages: 
    1. The learning stage, when learners are trained on a training set 
    2. The performance stage where the model is tested using an independent test set.
- This week we will cover classification models 
- Next week (and the last week of this course), we will cover regression methods


-VV-
# What is classification?
- Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning where matching targets (y) and input data (X) are used to train the model.
- The goal of classification algorithms is to uncover a perfect relationship $f(X)=y$ 
- However, in reality data is noisy... therefore $f(X)=y +\epsilon$
- In Classification we use some computational method to train a model $\hat f(X) \approx f(X)$:
    - Which means we try to find a mapping function (f)
    - Based on some input dataset (X)
    - To create discrete output labels (y)
    - That is close as possible to the hypothetical model $f(X)$

-VV-
# Types of classification tasks 
- Binary Classification: Classification task with two possible outcomes. Eg: Young/Old or Male/Female
- Multi-class classification: Classification with more than two classes. Eg: Visual/Auditory/Motor
- Multi-label classification: Classification task where each sample is mapped to a set of target labels (more than one class).  
Eg: Attention/Working memory AND Object/Spatial/Number AND Patient/HC 

-VV-
# Standard steps involved in building a classification model
- Initialize a classifier. Initialization commonly involves defining initial parameters specific to the type of classifier.
- Train the classifier. All classifiers in scikit-learn are trained using the same fit(X, y) method. That fits the model to the training data (X) and the matching label (y).
- Predict the target: Given an unseen observation X, the predict(X) returns the predicted label y.
- Evaluate the classifier model using different strategies

# let's get to know the different algorithms using toy data

- We will start by creating the simplest 2D data-set 
- Look at several methods 
- Then make the data more complex 

```python 
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=500,n_classes=2,n_redundant=0,n_repeated=0,n_informative=1
                           ,n_clusters_per_class=1,n_features=2,random_state=2020)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(10, 4))
ax[0].scatter(X[:,0],y,c=y);
ax[1].scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c=y);
```


-VV-

# The benefits of using sklearn tools are their simplicity and consistency 
- We will explore the following methods (however feel free to expand further)
    - [Decision trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#classification):  Find usefull points in the feature space to generate seperation rules 
    - KNN: store training data to create [neighborhood based model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbors-classification) 
    - LDA: Use class conditional distribution to create [discriminant based model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/lda_qda.html#mathematical-formulation-of-the-lda-and-qda-classifiers)
    - SVM: Find useful subset of the data [support vectors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification) to define a gap between classes 
    - [Logistic regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression): identify a minimal a straight smooth plane that seperates between classes  
    


-VV-

# The players     
```python 
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```

-VV-

# The container
```python 
models = {"KNN":KNeighborsClassifier()
    ,"LDA":LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()
    ,"TREE":DecisionTreeClassifier()
    ,"SVC":SVC()
    ,"LOGC":LogisticRegression()}
```

-VV-

# Why do we need to approximate classifiers perfomance?
- Estimating classifiers performance is an essential tool for answering some of the following questions:
    - Is there any useful information that can be used to classify events above random chance
    - Compare between information sources. I.e. which subsets of the data are more informative  
    - Identify/rank important sources of information. I.e. are there individual features that contribute more information than other
    - Distinguish between global or local effects
    - Are the natural separations in the data linear, polynomial or non-linear                      



-VV-

# How do we estimate classifiers perfomance 
- There are several [ways](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#metrics-and-scoring-quantifying-the-quality-of-predictions) 
the simplest is using some metric that evaluates the perfomance of each method
- Among the many different metrics, the easiest to understand is classification accuracy
- This measure simply counts the amount of accuratly predicted labels and divids them by the total number of events 


-VV-

# The wrong way to measure classification accuracy
- Let's take the naive approach and understand the problems with it?

```python 
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
bad_perfomance = [None]*5
for i,(name,mdl) in enumerate(models.items()):
    bad_perfomance[i] = accuracy_score(y,mdl.fit(X,y).predict(X))
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6, 4))
ax.bar(range(5),height=bad_perfomance);  
ax.set_xticks(range(5))
ax.set_xticklabels(list(models.keys()));
for i,rect in enumerate(ax.patches):
    height = rect.get_height()
    ax.text(rect.get_x() + rect.get_width() / 2, height,
        f'{bad_perfomance[i]:.2f}',ha='center', va='bottom');                
```

-VV-

# We were measuring the method tendency to overfit 
- When we are creating a classification model, we aim to identify general/global patterns 
that describe some real phenomena that differentiate between the two groups  
- Overfitting describes the situation where the model is uncovering local noise patterns that 
are specific to the data-set but do not reflect a real effect 
- As a result, the model will be extremely accurate in the training stage but will fail when tested on unseen data 
- This example also highlights the sensitivity of non-parametric models (decision trees) to overfit data 


-VV-
# Another problem the previous example had 
- We performed another mistake in the last example
- A model is trained by maximizing its accuracy on the training dataset
- However, performance is determined on its ability to perform well on unseen data.
- In this case, overfitting reflects our model attempt to memorize the training data as opposed 
to uncovering generalized patterns existing in the training data.

-VV-
# overfitting causes 
- High dimensional data is susceptible to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) 
- The larger the feature space, the more it is affected by local noise patterns 
- This problem of higher dimension is known as the Curse of Dimensionality.
- To avoid overfitting, the needed data will need to grow exponentially as you increase the number of dimensions.
- Also, small datasets are more sensitive to the effects of noise 
- Unfortunatly we don’t usually have the luxury of gathering an extensive database in neuroscience. 
- We need a way to approximate real perfomance 

   
-VV-
# [Cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation-evaluating-estimator-performance) as a solution 
- Cross-validation is a set of techniques for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.
- The simplest way to cross-validate is to split the dataset into two parts (training and testing) and approximate performance only on the test-set 

-VV-

# Let's update (increase dimensionality) our example and estimate performance 
- The first plot shows the association between samples, and the square pattern is evidence for clustering 
- The second shows the association between features
- Based on what we now know we would expect near-perfect classification on training set now 

```python 
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=500,n_classes=2,n_redundant=5,flip_y=0,n_repeated=2,
                    n_informative=10,n_clusters_per_class=1,n_features=20,random_state=2020)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(10, 4))
ax[0].imshow(np.corrcoef(X));
ax[1].imshow(np.corrcoef(X.T));
```
-VV-

# Let us test this assumption 

```python 
bad_perfomance = [None]*5
for i,(name,mdl) in enumerate(models.items()):
    bad_perfomance[i] = accuracy_score(y,mdl.fit(X,y).predict(X))
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6, 4))
ax.bar(range(5),height=bad_perfomance);  
ax.set_xticks(range(5))
ax.set_xticklabels(list(models.keys()));
for i,rect in enumerate(ax.patches):
    height = rect.get_height()
    ax.text(rect.get_x() + rect.get_width() / 2, height,
        f'{bad_perfomance[i]:.2f}',ha='center', va='bottom');    
```


-VV-

# The data is both high-dimensional and very clean, let's add some noise  
- flip_y controls the fraction of samples whose class is assigned randomly.
- Larger values introduce noise in the labels and make the classification task harder.

```python 
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=500,n_classes=2,n_redundant=5,flip_y=0.5,n_repeated=2,
                    n_informative=10,n_clusters_per_class=1,n_features=20,random_state=2020)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(10, 4))
ax[0].imshow(np.corrcoef(X));
ax[1].imshow(np.corrcoef(X.T));
```

-VV-

# Let's create a plot function to clean our code 
```python
def plot_bar(perfomance,labels):
    n = perfomance.shape[0]
    f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6, 4))
    x,width = np.arange(n),0.35
    ax.bar(x-width/2,perfomance[:,0],width, label='train');   
    ax.bar(x+width/2,perfomance[:,1],width, label='test');   
    for i in range(n):
        r1,r2 = ax.patches[i],ax.patches[i+5]
        h1,h2 = r1.get_height(),r2.get_height()
        ax.text(r1.get_x() + r1.get_width() / 2, h1,
            f'{perfomance[i,0]:.2f}',ha='center', va='bottom')
        ax.text(r2.get_x() + r2.get_width() / 2, h2,
            f'{perfomance[i,1]:.2f}',ha='center', va='bottom')
    ax.set_xticks(range(n));
    ax.set_xticklabels(labels);
    plt.show() 
```

-VV-

# Now we will Compare perfomance on train vs test parts

- Lets split the data to two parts and examine the model perfomance on the unseen part compared to the trained subset


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,test_size=0.2, random_state=2020, shuffle=True,stratify=y)
perfomance = np.zeros((5,2))
for i,(name,mdl) in enumerate(models.items()):
    perfomance[i,0] = accuracy_score(y_train,mdl.fit(X_train,y_train).predict(X_train))
    perfomance[i,1] = accuracy_score(y_test,mdl.fit(X_train,y_train).predict(X_test))
    
labels = list(models.keys())    
plot_bar(perfomance,labels)
```

-VV-

# Some methods are much more sensitive to overfitting
- It is clear that all models have a substantial decrease in accuracy when applied to the unseen subset 
- Each type of model has different ways of dealing with overfitting 
- For example in KNN increasing the number neighbors forces the model to take into account more points 
when assigning a label to unseen data and as a result the learned pattern is less specific 

```python
perfomance = np.zeros((5,2))
for i,k in enumerate(np.arange(2,12,2)):
    tmp = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k).fit(X_train,y_train)
    perfomance[i,0] = accuracy_score(y_train,tmp.predict(X_train))
    perfomance[i,1] = accuracy_score(y_test,tmp.predict(X_test))
labels = [f'KNN-k={x}' for x in np.arange(2,12,2)]
plot_bar(perfomance,labels)
```

-VV-

# Reducing dimensionality in decision trees 

- We saw that decision trees are susceptive to overfitting 
- One reason for that is that unless told otherwise, the algorithm will find some rule to split all leaves (samples)
- We can constrain this behaviour by forcing depth threshold  
- This will result in a tree that only has the most informative dimensions
- Examine the dramatic effect pruning (restricting the depth of the tree) the tree has  


```python
perfomance = np.zeros((5,2))
for i,k in enumerate(np.arange(1,6,1)):
    tmp = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=k).fit(X_train,y_train)
    perfomance[i,0] = accuracy_score(y_train,tmp.predict(X_train))
    perfomance[i,1] = accuracy_score(y_test,tmp.predict(X_test))
labels = [f'depth={x}' for x in np.arange(1,6,1)]
plot_bar(perfomance,labels)
```

-VV-

# We can also control the number of leaves each rule has 
- By default, each leaf is equivalent to one sample 
- In this context, a split rule can separate between two samples 
- This behaviour is precisely opposite to converging on general split points 
- And unsurprisingly it has a similar effect 

```python
perfomance = np.zeros((5,2))
for i,k in enumerate(np.arange(5,55,10)):
    tmp = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=k).fit(X_train,y_train)
    perfomance[i,0] = accuracy_score(y_train,tmp.predict(X_train))
    perfomance[i,1] = accuracy_score(y_test,tmp.predict(X_test))
labels = [f'min_s={x}' for x in np.arange(5,26,5)]
plot_bar(perfomance,labels)
```
-VV-

# Limitations of the train test split approach 

- Requires big datasets 
- Wasteful (a significant portion of the data is not used)
- Is simple to manipulate (aka cherry-picking a random sample that is not representative of the reality)
- Suffers from knowledge leakage (happens when the method's parameters are optimised to the test set)
- One solution calls for a 3-way splitting instead of the 2-way train/test 
    - Separating data into training, validation and test
    - Using the validation set for Parameter tweaking
    - Reporting performance based on the test set 
- However, this method solves one problem but intensifies the rest.

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 15vmin">Cross-validation</p>

-VV-

# Cross-validation is one possible solution
- Cross-validation is a family of splitting concepts used to reduce overfitting effects 
while leaning patterns from all the training data
- The most basic approach is called k-fold where the k validation/training subsets of the data are created 
- Importantly, when using k-fold CV we need to make sure each test fold has enough samples 
- Let's explore this visually 

```python
k = 10
n = len(y)
split = n//k
```


-VV-

# K-fold 
- Examining the plot below should persuade you that each fold captures both positive and negative classes 
- However, this is only true for cases when events are unsorted and randomly sampled
- This method will fail for sorted events as can be seen in the bottom panel 


```python
import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec
tick_args = {"axis" : "both", "which" : "both", "bottom" : False,
       "top" : False,"labelbottom":False, "right":False, "left":False, "labelleft":False}
folds = np.eye(10)[np.repeat(np.arange(0,10), split)].astype(bool)
f = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
gs = gridspec.GridSpec(5, 1,hspace=1)
ax = (plt.subplot(gs[0, 0]),plt.subplot(gs[1:4, 0]),plt.subplot(gs[4, 0]))
ax[0].imshow(np.eye(2)[y].T, interpolation='nearest',aspect='auto');
ax[0].set_title('Response vector')
ax[0].set_yticks(np.arange(2))
ax[0].tick_params(axis= "x", which= "both", bottom= False,labelbottom=False)
ax[0].set_yticklabels(["Negative","Positive"])
ax[1].imshow(folds.T, interpolation='nearest',aspect='auto');
ax[1].tick_params(**tick_args)
ax[1].set_title('10-folds index matrix')
ax[1].set_ylabel(f"Folds (K={k})")
ax[2].imshow(np.eye(2)[np.sort(y)].T.T, interpolation='nearest',aspect='auto');
ax[2].set_title('Sorted response vector (Negative/Positive)')
ax[2].tick_params(**tick_args)
ax[2].set_xlabel(f"Samples (N={n})");
```


-VV-

# K-fold (cont.)
- The solution is simple, instead of troubling ourselves we can just shuffle the fold matrix  

```python
rng = np.random.RandomState(2020)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10, 4))
v = np.repeat(np.arange(0,10), split)
rng.shuffle(v)
folds = np.eye(10)[v].astype(bool)
ax.imshow(folds.T, interpolation='nearest',aspect='auto');
ax.tick_params(**tick_args)
ax.set_title('10-folds index matrix')
ax.set_ylabel(f"Folds (K={k})");
```

-VV-

# K-fold (using sklearn)
- The previous examples were intended to explain the concept graphically 
- Instead of using your own function it is better to use sklearn internal cross-validation functions 
- Let's visually confirm that this is the same

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
cv = KFold(n_splits=k,random_state=2020, shuffle=True)
folds = np.zeros((len(y),k)).astype(bool)
for i,(train_index, test_index) in enumerate(cv.split(y)):
    folds[test_index,i] = True   
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10, 4)) 
ax.imshow(folds.T, interpolation='nearest',aspect='auto');
ax.tick_params(**tick_args)
ax.set_title('10-folds index matrix')
ax.set_ylabel(f"Folds (K={k})");                    
```


-VV-

# Before we move on lets make a barplot function with error bars 

```python
def plot_error_bar(perfomance,labels):
    n = perfomance.shape[0]
    f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6, 4))
    x,width = np.arange(n),0.8
    mu = np.mean(perfomance,axis=1)
    sd = np.std(perfomance,axis=1)
    ax.bar(x,mu,width,yerr=sd,align='center',alpha=0.5,ecolor='black',capsize=10);   
    for i in range(n):
        r = ax.patches[i]
        h = r.get_height()
        ax.text(r.get_x() + r.get_width() / 2, h+sd[i]*1.2,
            r'$%.2f\pm%.2f$'%(mu[i],sd[i]),ha='center', va='bottom')
    ax.set_xticks(range(n));
    ax.set_xticklabels(labels);
    ax.set_ylim(0,1)
    plt.show() 
```

-VV-

# Let's use CV to generate some error bars  
- One of the benefits of using CV is that it is the fastest way to estimate some idea regarding the boundaries of your method's performance 
```python
cv = KFold(n_splits=k,random_state=2020, shuffle=True)
perfomance = np.zeros((5,10))
for i,(name,mdl) in enumerate(models.items()):
    for j,(ix_train, ix_test) in enumerate(cv.split(y)):
        perfomance[i,j] = accuracy_score(y[ix_test],mdl.fit(X[ix_train],y[ix_train]).predict(X[ix_test]))
labels = list(models.keys())    
plot_error_bar(perfomance,labels)
```

-VV-

# What are we missing? 
- We have some error around the accuracy 
- However, we are oblivious to how the models are performing internally 
- More specifically the accuracy measure we use is not providing us with any per class insight 
- Let's dig deeper and examine (in the next section) the [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix)

-VV-

# Confusion matrix 
- The Confusion matrix allows visualization of the performance of classification methods
- To understand this better let us take a step back and return to the train test split 
- The central part of the confusion matrix is composed of counting performance per class 
- In the case of the 2-way classification problem (i.e. binary) it is a 2 x 2 matrix 
- The diagonal represents samples classified correctly and the anti-diagonal those that were misclassified

-VV-

# Confusion matrix 
- let's create this ourselves 
- It is immediately apparent that KNN is biased towards the negative class 
- However, we would like to have more info to capture the different aspects of the performance of the method

# Confusion matrix (cont.) 
- The confusion_matrix function is extracting the core information comparing the true labels and the predicted ones 
- The actual numbers are important (as they immediately give an understanding of how the model performed)
- But using these it is also possible to derive some more sophisticated performance metrics 

```python 
yhat = mdl.fit(X_train,y_train).predict(X_test)
C = np.unique(y_test)
ix_0 = y_test==C[0]
ix_1 = y_test==C[1]
TP  = np.sum(y_test[ix_1]==yhat[ix_1])
TN  = np.sum(y_test[ix_0]==yhat[ix_0])
FN  = np.sum(y_test[ix_1]!=yhat[ix_1])
FP  = np.sum(y_test[ix_0]!=yhat[ix_0])
print(f"{TN}|{FN}\n{FP}|{TP}")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test,yhat))

# Beyond accuracy 
- [Precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) 
    - Precision is the fraction of true positives divided by the total number of samples classified as positive (i.e. $TP/(TP+FP)$)
    - Recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of true positives divided by the total number of actual positive samples.  (i.e. $TP/(TP+FN)$)
- [The F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is the harmonic mean of the Precision and recall 
- Matthews correlation coefficient [MCC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef.html#sklearn-metrics-matthews-corrcoef) takes into account true and false positives and negatives. It is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes.

# Let's extend the current confusion_matrix to be more informative 

```python 
def calc_confusion_matrix(y,yh):
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,matthews_corrcoef
    from sklearn.metrics import f1_score,accuracy_score
    tp,fp,fn,tn = tuple(confusion_matrix(y,yh).reshape(-1))
    acc = accuracy_score(y,yh)
    f1 = f1_score(y,yh)
    mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y,yh)
    N,P = np.sum(np.eye(2)[y.reshape(-1)],axis=0)
    T = N+P
    PPV = tp/(tp+fp) # Positive Precision
    NPV = tn/(tn+fn) # Negative Precision
    TPR = tp/(tp+fn) # Recall/Sensitivity
    SPC = tn/(tn+fp) # Specificity
    CM = np.zeros((4,4))
    CM[0,:] = [T,P,N,acc]
    CM[1,:] = [tp+fp,tp,fp,PPV]

# What next?

- You guessed it we will now create a plot confusion matrix function

# All of these tools allow us to understand and compare classification

- We want some way to gain insights about performance confidence interval 
- In the next and final section this week we will learn how to extract some statistics using Shuffle and Split

# What is Random permutation cross-validation
- Essentially, the permutation test procedure measures how likely the observed accuracy would be obtained by chance. 
- A p-value represents the fraction of random data sets under a certain null hypothesis where the classifier behaved as well as or better than in the original data.
- The assumption here is that the original data (X) contains some real dependency between data points and labels. 
- To test that we need to create a situation where we break that dependency

-VV-
# A Simple Permutation example 
- We will create two null models 
    - In the first, we will permute the order of the labels - thus breaking the dependency between labels and data 
    - In the second we permute the data 
    - Importantly these are two simple examples - this is an active research field                        

```python 
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(20, 8))
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,test_size=0.2, random_state=2020, shuffle=True,stratify=y)

# Now lets create a null distribution of f1-score

n_perms = 1e4
F1_True = f1_score(y_test,mdl.fit(X_train,y_train).predict(X_test))
F1_Null = np.zeros((n_perms,2))
for i in range(n_perms):
    F1_Null[i,0]= f1_score(y_test,mdl.fit(X_train,np.random.permutation(y_train)).predict(X_test))                         
    F1_Null[i,1]= f1_score(y_test,mdl.fit(np.random.permutation(X_train),y_train).predict(X_test))                         
```

# And visualize it

```python 
plt.hist(F1_Null[:,0], 50, density=True, facecolor='g', alpha=0.25);
plt.hist(F1_Null[:,1], 50, density=True, facecolor='r', alpha=0.25);
ylim = plt.ylim()
plt.plot(2 * [F1_True], ylim, '--k', linewidth=3, label='True Model')
plt.plot(2 * [np.mean(F1_Null[:,0])], ylim, '--g', linewidth=3, label='Chance (y)')
plt.plot(2 * [np.mean(F1_Null[:,1])], ylim, '--r', linewidth=3, label='Chance (X)')

plt.ylim(ylim)

# What about significance ? 

- We can calculate a p-value, which approximates the probability that the score would be obtained by chance. 
- This is calculated as $(C+1)/(n_permutations + 1)$, Where C is the number of permutations whose score >= the true score.
- And as you can see both are significant 
```python 
   p0 = (np.sum(F1_Null[:,0]>F1_True)+1)/(n_perms+1)
   p1 = (np.sum(F1_Null[:,1]>F1_True)+1)/(n_perms+1)
