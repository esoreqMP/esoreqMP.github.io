<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 15vmin">Last week recap</p>

-VV-

# Last week we:
- Used NiBabel to read brain grey matter volumes
- Using these volumes, we learned:
    - How to generate a vanilla multi-plane multi-dimensional viewing function
    - And how to create a crude animation within Jupyter to eye-ball our data before mining
- We then learned how to mine the VBM signal intensity with and without a mask 
- As expected the magnitude of the masked data was higher than without the mask 
- Do you understand why this is what we would expect?

    
-VV-
# Last week functions with some extras
- This additional functionality allows extracting ROI data 
- It is explained below in detail 
- However, if you don't want to dive in you can copy the function and move right to the next section

```python 
def mine_vbm(file,mask=False):
    vol = nib.load(file).get_fdata()                
    vox = vol.reshape(-1) # reshape the 3d volume to 1d vector  
    if np.all(mask):
        return np.mean(vox)
    elif len(np.unique(mask))==2:
        return np.mean(vox[mask.reshape(-1)]) 
    else:
        mask = mask.astype(int)
        roi = np.squeeze(np.eye(mask.max()+1)[mask.reshape(-1)])                
        mag_sum =  vox.reshape(1,-1) @  roi  
        mag_mean = mag_sum/np.sum(roi,axis=0) 
        return mag_mean[0,1::]                  
```

-VV-

# Using spatial information to reduce dimensionality? 
- Last week session we used a template mask to minimise redundant information 
- We ended the session with a suggestion to use an atlas to independently mine signals from different parts of the brain 
- This can be achieved with a label map which replaces the binary mask with a label map that clusters together voxels that share some common features 
- Today we will be using a label map that is spatially constrained 

-VV-

# load the ROI map 

```python 
Temp = nib.load('Template_6.nii.gz').get_fdata()
GM_temp = Temp[:,:,:,0]
ROI = nib.load('GM_ROI.nii.gz').get_fdata()
```

-VV-

# Visually examine the label map 
- We will be using `get_plane` from last week

```python
def get_plane(M,ix,dim,rot=0):
    d = M.shape
    padding = [(x, x) for x in tuple(np.abs(d-np.max(d))//2)]
    vol = np.pad(M,padding)
    plane = vol.take(indices=ix, axis=dim)
    if rot: 
        plane = np.rot90(plane,rot)
    return plane
```

-VV-

# Overlay onto the template

- It is always good practice to confirm alignment between the template/data and the atlas/label map


```python
d = np.max(GM_temp.shape)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(20, 6)) 
ax.imshow(get_plane(GM_temp,60,2,1), cmap='gray');
ax.imshow(get_plane(ROI,60,2,1), cmap='jet', alpha=0.5);
plt.show()
```

-VV-

# We are now ready to mine the data 

- There are many ways to extract values from imaging data using a label map 
- Most will start with a loop for all subjects and an inner loop for all cluster 
- While there is nothing wrong with this approach, it is extremely slow compared to the vectorized alternative 

-VV-

# But what is vectorization?
- Using NumPy arrays, we can avoid loops (Which are slow in Python) for various elementwise arithmetic operations on the data. 
- This process is usually called vectorization. 
- For those interested [here is an excellent overview with examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vectorization-in-python/)
- We used vectorization to speed-up the mapping process in our us_to_states function 
- In this case, we will use vectorization for two essential reasons 
    - Converting our label map to dummy (boolean) variables 
    - Using our dummy ROI set to extract mean values for each subject 

-VV-

# label to dummy space vectorized (in steps)

- In linear algebra, the identity matrix is the n × n square matrix with ones on the leading diagonal and zeros elsewhere. 
- In NumPy (and Matlab) we create such matrices using the np.eye command

```python
eye = np.eye(10)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(20, 6)) 
ax.imshow(eye, cmap='gray');
```

-VV-

# label to dummy space vectorized (step 2)
- In the context of dummy variables, the identity matrix we previously created is equivalent to dummy form of 0:9 vector
```python
label_with_eye = np.concatenate([np.arange(10).reshape(-1,1),eye.astype(int)],axis=1)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(20, 6)) 
ax.imshow(label_with_eye, cmap='jet');
```

-VV-

# label to dummy space vectorized (step 3)
- We can use integer indices to map the eye to a more complex vector 
- In the below toy example we have 10 classes and 100 events that map to these classes 
```python
index = np.random.randint(0, high=10, size=100)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(20, 6)) 
ax.imshow(np.concatenate([index.reshape(-1,1),np.eye(10)[index].astype(int)],axis=1), cmap='jet',aspect=0.1);
```

-VV-

# label to dummy space vectorized (step 4)
- In the case of our brain data we have $121 x 145 x 121 = 2,122,945$ voxels 
- And we have `ROI.max() = 157` classes 
- looping over this would have required at least 157 steps for each subject and would take forever 
- Using the vectorized form takes approximately 1.5 seconds 

```python
ROI = nib.load('../GM_ROI.nii.gz').get_fdata().astype(int)
roi = np.eye(ROI.max()+1)[ROI.reshape(-1)]
roi.shape
```

-VV-

# How do we use the labels to mine local VBM values?
- We want to be able to extract the mean density for each of our regions of interest 
- A simple way to achieve that would require matrix multiplication 
- For those without any prior background in linear algebra, [here is an excellent intuitive explanation on matrix multiplication](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/v/matrix-multiplication-intro)  
- However, simply put, matrix multiplication is the process of creating a new matrix where each cell is the sum of row by column multiplication



-VV-

# Just to make sure this vital concept is understood 

- The matrix multiplication of matrix A with m rows and n columns and matrix B with n rows and p columns results in matrix C with m rows and p columns 

$$ \underset{m \times n}{\mathrm{A}} \cdotp \underset{n \times p}{\mathrm{B}} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & \dots & a_{1n} \\\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\ a_{m1} &  \dots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} 
\cdotp \begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & \dots & b_{1p} \\\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\ b_{n1} &  \dots & b_{np} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} c_{11} & \dots & c_{1p} \\\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\ c_{m1} &  \dots & c_{mp} \end{bmatrix} =  \underset{m \times p}{\mathrm{C}}$$

- Where cell (i,j) in C is the sum of products of the corresponding ith row in A and jth column in B.

$$ A_{i \cdot} \cdotp B_{\cdot j} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{i1} & \dots & a_{in} \end{bmatrix} \cdotp  
\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} \\\\ \vdots \\\\ b_{n1} \end{bmatrix}
= \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik} b_{kj} = C_{ij} $$


-VV-
# How does this help us?

- In our case, we have the VBM magnitude (for one subject) as a vector (with the shape of (2122945,1))
- And the dummy ROI matrix we just created (with the shape of (2122945,158))
- The essential rule in matrix multiplication is that the inner dimensions have to match 
- In other words, if we multiply the magnitude transposed, we get the sum of magnitude voxels within each ROI
- As our ROI have very different shapes and volumes, we divide by the number of voxels for each ROI 
- Finally, we remove the first value as it corresponds to ROI=0 which are all the voxels that are not within our ROI set
 

```python 
mag_sum = vox.T @ roi
mag_mean = mag_sum/np.sum(roi,axis=0) 
mag_mean = mag_mean[0,1::]
```

-VV-
# Here is the final mining function we started with

```python 
def mine_vbm(file,mask=False):
    vol = nib.load(file).get_fdata()                
    vox = vol.reshape(-1) # reshape the 3d volume to 1d vector  
    if np.all(mask):
        return np.mean(vox)
    elif len(np.unique(mask))==2:
        return np.mean(vox[mask.reshape(-1)]) 
    else:
        mask = mask.astype(int)
        roi = np.squeeze(np.eye(mask.max()+1)[mask.reshape(-1)])                
        mag_sum =  vox.reshape(1,-1) @  roi  
        mag_mean = mag_sum/np.sum(roi,axis=0) 
        return mag_mean[0,1::]         
```

<!-- .slide: id="UML Clustering"  -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="#ffffff" data-transition="zoom" -->
<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 15vmin">Unsupervised learning <br> Clustering background</p>

-VV-
# What is Unsupervised Learning?
- Unsupervised learning (UML) is the process of learning/identifying some structure in **unlabelled** data. 
- In other words, we are interested solely in attributes of the feature space itself. 
- Here I am listing the key concepts in this field 

-VV-
# What is cluster analysis?

- One of the most common question UML tries to solve is whether the features form specific clusters or sub-groups in feature space.
- This essential unsupervised learning technique is known as cluster analysis.

-VV-
# Clustering analysis objective

- For a set of elements with a common feature space, we want to group similar events based on some **distance** measure.
- Practically we need to assign a cluster label to elements that share some pattern across a feature space to partition them into groupings or clusters. 

-VV-
# Clustering open questions

- What do we mean by “similar”? 
- How do we quantify similarity?
- What is a good grouping? 
- How do we choose the number of clusters? 
- Flat or hierarchical clustering?


-VV-
# Major General types of clustering
- “Soft” versus “hard.” 
    - Soft = each event cluster assignment is distributed across several groups
    - Hard = each event is only assigned to one label
- Flat versus hierarchical 
    - No nested clusters
    - Clusters form a hierarchy 
- Agglomerative versus Divisive 
    - Agglomerative =  Bottom-up creation of clusters, beginning with the pairing of single events together until the final groups are formed 
    - Divisive =  Top-down formation of clusters beginning with the entire sample and dividing it to groups  based on some criteria 

-VV- 
# Non-distributional Distance measures
- The heart and soul of any clustering process lies in how we measure distance or (dis)similarity between events
- When dealing with continuous measures, two of the most common ways to measure magnitude differences between multivariate events are: 
    - l1-Norm (aka Manhatten distance) $d_1(x,y)= \sum^n_{i=1}|x_i-y_i|$ 
    - l2-Norm (aka Euclidean distance) $d_2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum^n_{i=1} (x_i-y_i)^2} $
- Where **Norm** refers to the a nonnegative value quantifying the vector’s magnitude (across the n-dimensional space).
- This can be generalized to the Minkowski distance metric $d_p(x,y) = (\sum^n_{i=1} |x_i-y_i|^p)^{1/p}$ 
- The range here is 0 (no distance) and +inf 


-VV- 
# Correlation as the distance between angles 
- The choice of similarity measure can shape how your data is interpreted 
- In contrast to the magnitude distance measures, the distance between angles gives a different complementary measure 
- As expected this measure is not sensitive to magnitude differences but instead compares the shape similarity  
    - Pearson correlation $r_{xy} = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}$
    - Cosine similarity $\frac{\sum x_i y_i}{\sqrt{\sum^n_{i=1}x_i^2}\sqrt{\sum^n_{i=1}y_i^2}}$
- It is easy to see that the Cosine similarity is a special case of Pearson correlation when both means are zero 

-VV- 
# Let's compare these with a toy example 
- We start by generating three events with 50 features that have some predefined similarity between them

```python
from numpy.random import multivariate_normal as mrnd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
np.random.seed(2020)
v1,v2,v3,c1,c2 = 1,2,3,1.2,0.2
X = mrnd([1,25,10],[[v1,c1,c2],[c1,v2,c1],[c2,c1,v3]],size=50)
h = plt.plot(X);
plt.legend(h,bbox_to_anchor=(0.85, 0,0.5, 1));
```

-VV- 
# compare angle similarity and distance to magnitude distance

The correlation is a measure of similarity, to convert it to one of distance we can invert it using subtraction. 
It is immediately apparent that the correlation metric is sensitive to the shape similarity across dimensions. In contrast, the euclidean distance amplifies on the differences in magnitude. 

```python 
from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform,pdist
display(np.corrcoef(X.T))
display(squareform(pdist(X.T,metric='euclidean')))
display(1-np.corrcoef(X.T))
```

-VV- 
# Importance of normalisation 
- Some of these measures assume normalised data (i.e. mean=0 and unit variance) 
- As a result, it is important to know which metric you use and the processing associated with it 

```python 
from sklearn import preprocessing
x_normelized = preprocessing.scale(X)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(12, 6)) 
h = ax[0].plot(X);
ax[0].legend(h,('l-01','l-02','l-03'),bbox_to_anchor=(0,1.02),loc="lower left",  ncol=3);
h = ax[1].plot(x_normelized);
ax[1].legend(h,('l-01','l-02','l-03'),bbox_to_anchor=(0,1.02),loc="lower left", ncol=3);
```

-VV- 
# effect of normalisation on distance

- Just compare the differences and think how easy it is to miss interpret these findings if you failed to normalise the data 
```python 
display(squareform(pdist(X.T,metric='cosine')))
display(squareform(pdist(x_normelized.T,metric='cosine')))
display(squareform(pdist(X.T,metric='euclidean')))
display(squareform(pdist(x_normelized.T,metric='euclidean')))
```

-VV- 
# Three common clustering algorithms (but there are many more) we will examine 

- K-means - hard clustering of events based on distance from centers ([in-depth](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms-part-9-k-means-example-in-python-f2ad05ed5203#:~:text=K%2DMeans%20Clustering%20is%20an,been%20trained%20with%20labeled%20data))
- GaussianMixture - soft clustering of events based on per cluster gaussian distribution ([in-depth](https://towardsdatascience.com/gaussian-mixture-models-explained-6986aaf5a95))
- Hierarchical Clustering - hard clustering of events to multiple levels of hierarchy ([in-depth](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms-part-12-hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering-example-in-python-1e18e0075019))

-VV- 

# Consider the following toy data-set

- We have three clusters 
- Within one of them we have a nested structure of three clusters 


```python 
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import seaborn as sns;
X, y = make_blobs(centers=5,n_samples=300,n_features=2, random_state=2020)
ax = sns.scatterplot(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], hue=y)
```

-VV- 

#  Let's fit some models 
- We are using sklearn structure to solve this simple problem 

```python 
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans,AgglomerativeClustering
import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as sch
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
kmn = KMeans(n_clusters=5).fit(X)
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=5).fit(X)
hcl = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=5, affinity='euclidean', linkage='ward').fit(X)
```

-VV-

#  Inspect the results 
- As you can visually see all models do a good job 


```python 
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,4,figsize=(15, 3)) 
sns.scatterplot(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], hue=y,ax=ax[0])
sns.scatterplot(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], hue=kmn.labels_,ax=ax[1])
sns.scatterplot(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], hue=np.argmax(gmm.predict_proba(X),axis=1),ax=ax[2])
sns.scatterplot(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], hue=hcl.labels_,ax=ax[3])
```

-VV- 

# What about more complex data sets? 

- We have three classes 
- However we now have 50 features not two 


```python 
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
import seaborn as sns;
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=300,n_features=50, n_informative=6, random_state=2020,n_redundant=10, n_repeated=0, n_classes=3, n_clusters_per_class=1)
ax = sns.scatterplot(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], hue=y)
```
-VV- 

# Let's examine the similarity pattern 
- Can we see a pattern in the paired similarity? 

```python 
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10, 10)) 
ax.imshow(np.corrcoef(X))
```

-VV- 

# Let's use hcl to sort the data 
- Now the pattern is clear 

```python 
hcl = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=3, affinity='euclidean', linkage='ward').fit(X)
ix = np.argsort(hcl.labels_)
f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10, 10)) 
ax.imshow(np.corrcoef(X[ix,:]))
```

-VV- 

# Can we simplify the data 
- This is a job for dimensionality reduction

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 15vmin">Unsupervised learning <br> Dimensionality reduction </p>


-VV-
# What is Dimensionality reduction
- Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features under consideration by compressing dimensionality with minimal loss of information.


-VV- 

#  The Curse of Dimensionality
- The curse of dimensionality refers to problems that arise when working with data in the higher dimensions.
- This is also called the small m large n problem i.e. any situation where you have more features than events 
- Here is a (nice article)[https://towardsdatascience.com/the-curse-of-dimensionality-50dc6e49aa1e] presenting the problem intuitivly 


-VV- 

# neuro-based data suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality but is also 
- Always noisy  
- With many redundant features
- Almost always with more features than independent events 
- And each independent sample (e.g. subject) is known to have strong individual patterns 



-VV- 

# One possible solution is to reduce the dimensionality
- This is useful in reducing the complexity of models 
- Speeding up computational processes 
- Visualizing reduced feature space 

-VV- 

# Principal components of data
- Principal components analysis is the primary method used for linear dimension reduction.
- The idea is to find the 𝐾 principal components directions (called the loadings) that capture the variation
in the data as much as possible.
- Simply put, we want to compress our feature space as much as possible.
- [Here is a 10-minute read that explains the idea further](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-pca-fae3e243731d) 


-VV- 

# Continuing with our previous example set 

- If we examine the fake data creation process, we can see that there are only six informative features 
- However, we don't know which features are of value 
- If we use PCA to model the data and visualize the first two components, we can see that we can identify the three clusters  

```python 
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
mdl = PCA().fit(X)
PC = mdl.transform(X)
ax = sns.scatterplot(x=PC[:,0], y=PC[:,1], hue=y)
```


-VV- 

# How well is the information preserved 

- Examining the magnitude of explained variance the first ten components capture is a good way to estimate the usefulness of the process 

```python 
plt.bar(range(10),mdl.explained_variance_ratio_[0:10])
```

-VV- 

# What about non-linear cases 
- PCA is a linear method, and it requires some linear separation of the data 
- Furthermore, even in our toy example, we needed more than two features to capture around 75% of the variance 
- Manifold learning is an umbrella term for the various ways that allow us to reduce dimensionality for non-linear cases  
- We will examine t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ([TSNE](https://towardsdatascience.com/t-sne-clearly-explained-d84c537f53a)) as a test case 
- The idea is to iteratively reduce dimensionality while preserving strong neighbourhood relationships (that are not necessarily linear)
```python
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
TC = TSNE().fit_transform(X)
ax = sns.scatterplot(x=TC[:,0], y=TC[:,1], hue=y)
```
