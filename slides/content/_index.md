# Reproducible Science and Jupyter Notebook
<!-- .slide: id="home" -->


- In this talk, I will go over the key benefits that rise from doing open reproducible science. 
- I will also go over the set of open source tools that I will force you to use in this course (and hopefully will continue to use after the course) that make creating reproducible science easier.
- This is by no means an exhaustive list 
- And the talk will cover the bare necessities (with some additional tricks)

## Learning Objectives

### At the end of the talk, you should be able to:

1. Define what open reproducible science is and (hopefully) understand its importance.
1. Know which key tools we will be using to implement our open reproducible science Projects.
1. Be able to start experimenting with these tools either on your personal computer or on the [High Performance Cluster (HPC)](https://info.gwdg.de/docs/doku.php?id=en:services:application_services:high_performance_computing:start)

## So What Should be Open in Open science?
- Everything !!!
- Open science is all about transparency at all levels of the scientific process. In other words making data, methods and findings easy to access, understand, reuse and ultimately extend and improve. 
- In other **Reproducible**

## Key tenets of science

- I think we all agree that one of the fundamental tenets of any science is reproducibility. More specifically, in order to make progress the scientific community should not accept any reporting of a "scientific" phenomena unless it is reproducible.

## if it's too good to be true it is probably wrong! 

- However, in modern data analysis, it is incredibly simple to get something wrong. This is especially true in most modern neuroscience experiments that are composed of many different measuring devices and involve complex pre and post pipelines.

## So What is Open Reproducible Science?


- Furthermore, it is even simpler to get something right but not realise it. The idea for this week is to setup our work framework to support reproducible science.

## Why Should <span style="color:GOLD">We</span> Bother?
 - Reproducibility is crucial for complex projects. Where a team of experts is formed, and each is in charge of a facet of the problem. 
- It is also simpler to enforce in teams, as it is crucial in effective Collaboration. 
- Furthermore, while neuroscience is a collaborative endeavor, most PhD students will work on specific projects sometimes alone. 


//slide//

## Why Should <span style="color:GOLD">You</span>  Bother?
- In this context, it is essential to understand that your collaborator is first and foremost your future self. 
- In other words, data projects tend to be revisited, and your future self will be grateful if you create a clear and straightforward analysis project. 

//slide//
## Still not Convinced?

- As aspiring scientists you should be able to share your work in a way that: 
     1. First allows others to understand what you did
     1. Then if needed do exactly what you did
     1. Using the same data you used
     1. And that this will produce the same result you had.

## Final note in this matter?
<!-- .slide: id="final" -->

- Having a straightforward, transparent notebook will allow future you as well as your peers, supervisors (and students) to make the most of your knowledge, and progress smoothly and quickly to projects that extend, improve and validate your findings.
