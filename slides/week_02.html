# Welcome to week 02 of the course

This week is all about integrating knowledge from the last two weeks and adding some advanced Python tools as well as Data science-focused modules in the Python eco-system specifically Numpy, Matplotlib and pandas. 

This week's last section is devoted to the assignment. I am still working on this section - will be uploaded shortly.

# What are list comprehensions?

- List comprehension is a way to define and create lists building on existing lists.
- The syntax is elegant **`some_list = [expression for item in list]`** 
- However, while list comprehension can always be rewritten in a for loop, the reverse is not always true.
- Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) If you want to know more 
- Consider the following:


```python
grid = []
for row in range(5):
    grid.append(list(range(5)))

```




    [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]



- How would you rewrite this using list comprehension?
- Move to the next slide **after** you have an idea or even a solution.

-VV- 

# List comprehensions grid example 

- Using list comprehensions the code is more straightforward and also easy to extend. 



```python
grid =  [list(range(5)) for row in range(5)]
grid
```




    [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]



- How would you rotate this grid using list comprehensions?
- Move to the next slide **after** you have an idea or even a solution.  

-VV-

# Nested List comprehensions rotated grid example 



```python
grid_rot90 = [[row[col] for row in grid] for col in range(5)]
grid_rot90
```




    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
     [3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]



- How would you create the multiplication matrix using list comprehensions?
- Move to the next slide **after** you have an idea or even a solution  

-VV-

# multiplication matrix example 



```python
prod_matrix = [[x*y for x in range(1,11)] for y in range(1,11)]
prod_matrix
```




    [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
     [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20],
     [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30],
     [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40],
     [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50],
     [6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60],
     [7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70],
     [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80],
     [9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90],
     [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]]



- Now a simple one: 
- given a sequence of 1-20 squared 
- Create two lists one with even and one with odds numbers
- Move to the next slide **after** you have an idea or better yet a solution  

-VV-

# Adding conditionals example 


```python
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,21) if x**2%2==0]
odd_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,21) if x**2%2!=0]
print(even_squares)
print(odd_squares)
```

    [4, 16, 36, 64, 100, 144, 196, 256, 324, 400]
    [1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169, 225, 289, 361]


-VV-

# map function

- The map function allows you to "map" a function to an iterable object. 
- in other words, we call the same function for every item in an iterable, such as a list. 
- For example, the function below is used to convert numeric age to a categorical age_group?


```python
def age_group(age):
    if age<=11:
        return 'children'
    elif age<=21:
        return 'teens'
    elif age<=65:
        return 'adults'
    else: 
        return 'elderly'
print(list(map(age_group,  list(range(1,90,3)))))

```

    ['children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly']


- Can you write this in one using the ternary form?

-VV-

# Same functionality oneliner




```python
def age2group(age):
    return 'children' if age<=11 else 'teens' if age<=21 else 'adults' if age<=65 else 'elderly'
age_group = list(map(age2group,  list(range(1,90,3))))
print(age_group)
```

    ['children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly', 'elderly']


-VV-

# what about multiple iterables?

- Map() can accept more than one iterable. 
- However, the iterables should be the same length
- If they are not, the shortest iterable will terminate the function



```python
def list2grid(s,e):
    return list(range(s,e))
grid = list(map(list2grid,  list(range(1,10)),list(range(2,30,3))))
grid
```




    [[1],
     [2, 3, 4],
     [3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
     [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
     [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13],
     [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16],
     [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
     [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22],
     [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]]



-VV-

# filter function

- The filter function creates an iterator containing only items for which a function(item) is true. 
- In other words, similar to map() you combine a function with a list.
- The list is then filtered returning only **True** results.
- Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter) If you want to know more 


```python
def is_children(age_group):
    return age_group == 'children'
print(list(filter(is_children, age_group)))
```

    ['children', 'children', 'children', 'children']


-VV-

# What are Lambda Expressions?

- A lambda function is used for creating small, one-time, anonymous function object in Python. 
- The syntax is simple: **`lambda argument: expression`**
- Because a lambda function is an expression, it can be named. 
- Multi-arguments are expressed by separating arguments with a comma (,)
- Lambda expressions are rarely named - these are just to make a point
- Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html?highlight=lambda#lambda-expressions) If you want to know more 


```python
square = lambda x: x**2
product = lambda x,y: x*y
power = lambda x,y: x**y
```

-VV-

# So when would we use Lambdas?
- You guessed it. They are used with map and filter to simplify our code and make it more human-readable 

-VV-

# Using if else in Lambda function

- Using if-else in lambda function is little tricky, the syntax is as follows 
- if you shouted Ternary Operators pat yourself on the back

```python
lambda <arguments> : <Value if True> if <condition> else <Value if False>
```



```python
age2group = lambda age: 'children' if age<=11 else 'teens' if age<=21 else 'adults' if age<=65 else 'elderly'
print(list(map(age2group,  list(range(1,30,1)))))

```

    ['children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'teens', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults', 'adults']


-VV-

# As part of your home assignment 

- Create a lambda function that gets a list of numbers (can be either ints or floats) and return the sign of the number 
- We will go over several solutions for this in the hands-on sess

-VV-

# Creating bollean values using conditional lambda 


```python
is_children = lambda age: age<=11 
print(list(map(age2group,filter(is_children, list(range(5,30,1))))))
```

    ['children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children']


-VV-

# Zip function 

- The zip() function returns an iterator of tuples based on the iterable objects.
- Combining it with all we learned so far is a powerful tool 
- Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) If you want to know more 


```python
num_list = list(range(1,7))
str_list  = list('string')
result = zip(num_list, str_list)
print(list(map(lambda a: str(a[0])+a[1], result)))
```

# Jupyter notebook 

- Magic commands are enhancements created for the interactive Python project which Jupyter notebook can be viewed as a web evolution of 
- Magic commands are designed to simplify everyday tasks in the standard data analysis workflow
- There are two types of Magic commands: 
    - Line magics, which are denoted by a single % prefix and operate on a single line of input, 
    - Cell magics, which are denoted by a double %% prefix and operate on multiple lines of input. 
- For a full list of magic commands press [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#line-magics)
- Here we will explore some of the most useful ones

# %time and %%time 

- When developing a pipeline, it is useful to know how much time a specific function needs 
- Time and its variations will do precisely that 
- To measure one line of code, we will use %time
- To measure a cell, we will use %%time



```python
%time print(list(map(age2group,filter(is_children, list(range(5,5000,1))))))
```

    ['children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children']
    CPU times: user 849 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 849 µs
    Wall time: 754 µs



```python
%%time
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,int(1e5)) if x**2%2==0]
odd_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,int(1e5)) if x**2%2!=0]
```

-VV-

#  %timeit  and %%timeit 

- %timeit will measure multiple iterations of the same line and show some stats on them
- %%timeit will do the same for the cell


```python
%timeit even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,int(1e5)) if x**2%2==0]
```

    44.4 ms ± 259 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)



```python

even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,int(1e5)) if x**2%2==0]
odd_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,int(1e5)) if x**2%2!=0]
```

    88.5 ms ± 543 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

# %load_ext autoreload

- This magic command is crucial for almost any actual work using Jupyter (except tutorials :)
- The  autoreload extension tracks any changes in your imports and will *auto* *reload* them to your scope 
- We will cover this in the next section when we explore how to use modules 
- But by running this, we allow any imported file to be updated 



```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

#  %system

- If you want access to the shell, this magic command will do it.


```python
%system date +%s%N

# Modules and Packages

- Python core language is compact. 
- This is an intentional design feature to maintain simplicity. 
- Much of the powerful functionality comes through external modules and packages.
- Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#modules) If you want to know more 

-VV-

#  Module


- A module is simply a file with the .py extension, containing Python definitions, functions, and statements. 
- Modules are imported from other modules using the import command.
- The first time a module is loaded into a running Python script, it is initialized by executing the code in the module once.
- If we change the module, we need to reload it for these changes to take effect

-VV-

# Modules are useful becuase they:

1. Simplify your code by calling readable functions instead of multiple lines of code
2. Make it simpler to maintain, improve and collaborate 
3. Allow you to organize your code in different files (each a different module)
     

-VV-

#  Creating a Module

- In  normal coding classes, students usually start by creating a script file with a py ending that prints **"Hello World"**
- However, in the  Jupyter notebook realm, it is useful to start by simply creating a text file called my_module.py
- We will copy every helpful function into that file
- As long as it is in the same folder as your notebook you can simply *import* it 
- Let's test this 

-VV-

#  Using jupyter magic to write a our my_module.py

- So we can use magic to create this file. However, it might be useful to open it afterwards as a text file so we can update it with any other helpful function (as we will see in the next sections) 
- The current example should not be considered good practice, it is just to show some functionality that we can relate to  
- Interesting fact, single underscores are a Python naming convention indicating that  the object is meant for internal use
- We are using this here to make the functions stand out visually


```python
%%writefile my_module.py
_sum_sq = lambda data: sum(x ** 2 for x in data)
_sum = lambda data: sum(x for x in data)
_mean = lambda data: _sum(data)/float(len(data))
_sq_mean = lambda data: _sum_sq(data)/float(len(data)-1)
_var = lambda data: sum((x - _mean(data))**2/float(len(data)-1) for x in data)
```

    Overwriting my_module.py


-VV-

#  Using import to load my_module


- Now we can import this python file and all the lambda function we defined exist in our scope 


```python
import my_module 

print(my_module._var(list(range(3,20))))

```

    25.5


-VV-

#  Add Sample standard deviation to your_module

- The standard deviation of the sample mean is defined using the following formula 

$$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum^n_{i=1} (x_i-\bar{x})^2} $$

- Try to implement your std function and place it into your module file
- Now see if it indeed reloads automagically 



```python
my_module._std(list(range(3,20)))
```

# How to define a package

- Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”
- They are simple directories, containing several python scripts.
- Defining a package in Python requires a uniqe folder and a special file called `__init__.py`
- For now this file can be empty 
- Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) If you want to know more 

-VV-

# make a directory called my_package

- We will use Jupyter magic to change the cell to `%%bash`
- And use what we learned in week_00 to create the following structure 



```bash
%%bash
mkdir -p my_package
touch my_package/__init__.py
cp my_module.py my_package/my_stats.py

```

-VV-

# Now we can import our package 

- Using the from notation we import the new my_stats module to our scope 



```python
from my_package import my_stats

my_stats._std(list(range(3,20)))
```

- To make it accessible, we need to restart the Jupyter notebook server



```python
python -m ipykernel install --user --name sys2020 --display-name "Python (sys2020)"
```

# I think this is the login .profile that is sourced in the jupyter server
<h2 style="background-color:red;color:white;padding:2%;">IN SSH TERMINAL ON YOUR COMPUTER.</h2>

- We could append the following to a .profile file in your home directory 
- This line should source the global anaconda settings on each login to the notebook server 

```bash
echo "if [ -f ~/opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh ]; then" >> ~/.profile 
echo ". /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh # --> source global conda.sh, if present." >> ~/.profile
echo "fi>> ~/.profile
```

# restart the jupyter notebook server 


- To make our environment accessible, we need to restart the Jupyter notebook server 
- You do this by pressing on the control panel button in the top right and stoping your server 
- If you want to remove this kernel (after the course has ended), you can use the following command 
- And then delete the actual environment 


```python
jupyter kernelspec remove sys2020
rm -rf rm -rf ~/anaconda3/envs/sys2020
```

# Important 
- On the GWDG cluster, this isn't necessarily the best approach 
- Therefore, after the course (or during it if you plan to start doing some work) I suggest you contact the IT group to make sure there isn't a better way 
- TBH it works, but I would have prefered working with a global anaconda using linux modules

# now we can install some essential packages we will use this week  
<h2 style="background-color:red;color:white;padding:2%;">IN SSH TERMINAL ON YOUR COMPUTER.</h2>

- We are going to install some more packages during the course 
- Most of you should have used all of these is some capacity or another 
- Therefore, I will allow myself to use Matplotlib to explain NumPy arrays 
- During this course, we will dive into the depth of Matplotlib, understand its benefits 
- And probably stop using it :)


```bash
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas 
```

# requirements. txt

- Last week we discussed the importance of tracking the software you use to allow you and other colleagues to retrace your steps without dealing with technical difficulties due to different versions 
- Anaconda environments were designed specifically to deal with this challenge 
- The list command will export the current dependencies and their versions
- The conda create --name <env_name> --file <.txt file> will create the exact enviorment 



```python
! conda list -e > requirements.txt

# Numpy Basics

- NumPy is **THE** numeric library for python.
- Almost all the packages we will use from now on will rely on NumPy on some way or another.
- It is also much faster and efficient than standard Python packages 
- NumPy is even more convenient. You get a lot of vector and matrix operations for free, which sometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary work. And they are also efficiently implemented.
- We won't cover all of Numpy functions and capabilities, but instead, we will focus on using vectors and arrays (politely ignoring matrix). 
- We will also cover some of the primary functions 
- But start by importing it to make sure it is loaded 


```python
import numpy as np
```

# Numpy Arrays

- NumPy’s main data structure is the multidimensional array.
- Numpy arrays essentially come in two flavors: vectors and matrices. 
- Vectors are strictly 1-d arrays and matrices are at least 1-d (but with thickness of 1).

-VV-

# Creating 1d vectors and Arrays

- There are many ways of creating vectors 
- The simplest would be to use the range generator 
- Importantly, a vector has no thickness
- T = transpose (i.e. fliping the array over its diagonal)



```python
vector_row = np.array(range(1,11))
array_1d_column = np.array([range(1,11)])
array_1d_row = np.array([range(1,11)]).T

print(vector_row.shape)
print(array_1d_column.shape)
print(array_1d_row.shape)

```

    (10,)
    (1, 10)
    (10, 1)


-VV-

# Creating 1d vectors and Arrays from lists 

- There are many more ways of creating arrays 


```python
vector_row = np.array([1]*10)
array_2d = np.array([[1]*10]*10)
array_3d_wide = np.array([[[0.5]*3]*200]*100)
array_3d_tall = np.array([[[0.5]*3]*100]*200)
print(array_3d_wide.shape)
print(array_3d_tall.shape)
```

    (100, 200, 3)
    (200, 100, 3)


-VV-

# Creating 1d vectors and Arrays from lists 

- Height, width, depth = array_3d.shape
- Note, however, that ndarray has matrix coordinates (i,j), which are opposite to image coordinates (x,y).
- y, x, z = array_3d.shape
- let's visualize this 



```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
# we import matplotlib module pyplot and name it plt
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
# we create a figure containing two side by side plots
ax1.imshow(array_3d_wide)
ax2.imshow(array_3d_tall)
# we use the function imshow to visualize these 3d matrices as images 

```

# Creating 1d vectors using numpy Built-in Methods

- linspace() creates linearly spaced values 
- logspace() creates log10 spaced values 
- arange() is similar to range (i.e. Array of values from to with steps) 




```python
vector_linspaced = np.linspace(0,50,6)
vector_logspace = np.logspace(0,5,6)
vector_step = np.arange(0,50,10) 
print(vector_linspaced)
print(vector_logspace)
print(vector_step)


```

    [ 0. 10. 20. 30. 40. 50.]
    [1.e+00 1.e+01 1.e+02 1.e+03 1.e+04 1.e+05]
    [ 0 10 20 30 40]


-VV-

# Let's manipulate depth  

- We will change the 2nd depth dimension (let's call it a slice) to 1 in the array_3d_wide
- And changing the 3rd slice to 1 in the array_3d_tall array we can see differences between them not only in shape but also in the depth 
- This is important - if this isn't clear please let me know 


```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
# we import matplotlib module pyplot and name it plt
array_3d_wide[:,:,1] = 1
array_3d_tall[:,:,2] = 1
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
# we create a figure containing two side by side plots
ax1.imshow(array_3d_wide)
ax2.imshow(array_3d_tall)
# we use the function imshow to visualize these 3d matrices as images

# Creating Arrays using numpy Built-in Methods

- Built-in methods require tuple or list to create >=2d arrays
- We can create arrays of full of zeros 
- And they can have predefined data types (which means we can sacrifice some accuracy in favour of memory 
- This process is called to preallocate a matrix 



```python
zeros_vector = np.zeros(10)
zeros_2d_array = np.zeros((10,10))
zeros_3d__int8_array = np.zeros((10,10,10),dtype="int8")
zeros_3d_float64_array = np.zeros([10,10,10],dtype="float64")
# we can go on and on 
print(zeros_3d__int8_array.dtype)
print(zeros_3d_float64_array.dtype)

```

    int8
    float64


-VV-

# Creating Arrays using numpy Built-in Methods

- We can also create ones, identity matrix (i.e. ones in the lead diagonal)
- And even with predefined values using full



```python
ones_3d_int8_array = np.ones([10,10,3])
eye_3d_bool_array = np.eye(10,dtype="b")
full_3d_array = np.full((10,10,3),156)
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3)
ones_3d_int8_array[:,3:-3,:] = 0
ones_3d_int8_array[3:-3,:,:] = 0
full_3d_array[2:,:5,:2] = 50
# we create a figure containing two side by side plots
ax1.imshow(eye_3d_bool_array)
ax2.imshow(ones_3d_int8_array)
ax3.imshow(full_3d_array)

```

# Creating Arrays using numpy Built-in Methods

- And even arrays with various randome number generators (e.g. rand, randint, randn)



```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
# we import matplotlib module pyplot and name it plt
uniform_noise = np.random.rand(10,10)# 
normal_noise = np.random.randn(10,10)# 
discrete_noise = np.random.randint(0,3,size=(10,10))# 

# we can go on and on 
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3)

ax1.imshow(uniform_noise)
ax2.imshow(normal_noise)
ax3.imshow(discrete_noise)
