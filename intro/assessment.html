        <h3>
            <p>We Have Finally Reached The End Of The Course</p>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the course, we touched many different aspects. 
            I hope you feel like you learned some new ways to explore data. 
            The objective of the final assessment is to consolidate the various aspects of 
            gaining some insights from a complex dataset. 
            The data you will use is part of the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) 
            and contains VBM data from 288 individuals across a heterogeneous age sample. </p>
        <p>The sample contains four groups: 
            Young, Middle Aged, Nondemented, and Demented Older Adults.
             Each individual has three Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) NifTi 
             maps: (1) grey-matter (c1) (2)  white-matter (c2) and (3) 
             cerebrospinal fluid (c3). It is up to you to decide which 
             tissue to use (if you are ambitious you can use all three 
             and compare between them).
            </p>
        <p> If you have any questions during the project, 
            you can reach me using my email eyalsoreq<at>gmail.com.</p>
        <h4>The assessment  is composed of several dependent steps: </h4>
         <ol> 
            <li>Load the demographics file and explore the data both visually 
            and by producing summary statistics tables.</li>
            <li>You will then need to load the VBM data and visually inspect it.</li>
            <li>Then use the matching ROI map to mine spatial independent measures.</li>
            <li>Then merge the mined VBM data with the demographics and use EDA to uncover any apparent relationships between the two perspectives. </li>
            <li>Use unsupervised learning approaches to visualize the high dimensional data set. </li>
            Can you see any clusters? 
            Can you use the categories in the demographics file to explain the clusters?
            Subset the data to focus on older adults and see if you can classify between the demented and non-demented samples. 
            How accurate is your model? 
            <li>Train two different classification methods and compare between them </li>
            Discuss the results 
            <li>The project should be submitted as a jupyter notebook and should contain the following:  	</li>
            <ul>A jupyter notebook
                <li>A python file containing functions. </li>
                <li>Each section in the analysis should have two markdown cells</li>
                <li>at the beginning outlying the objective of the section </li>
                <li>a concluding markdown cell summarizing the findings</li>
            </ul>
            <li>All notebooks should be submitted no later than the 10/08/2020</li></ol>
        <p>Thank you and good luck</p>
