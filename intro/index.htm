<h2 id="dear-students">Dear Students:</h2>
<h3>
    <p>Welcome to Artificial Intelligence &amp; Intelligent Systems.</p>
</h3>
<br>
<p>My name is Dr Eyal Soreq, and I am your instructor in this course.<br>
    This course will provide you with applied knowledge of central methods in modern data science and how to use
    them to address neurocognitive questions correctly.<br>
    It will also teach you how to use the GWDG cluster, a skill that is becoming crucial as data-sets become
    larger and more complex.<br>
    And hopefully, this course will also provide you with a strong foundation in how to conduct reproducible
    neurocognitive research.</p>
<p>In addition to welcoming you to the course, I would like to give you some helpful information and a few hints
    for successful completion of this course.<br>
    By now you should be very experienced with online courses.<br>
    As I see it, online courses provide a different way to study and require different skills from students.<br>
    You will find that, as an online learner, self-motivation and discipline are paramount.<br>
    This means that you are entirely responsible for establishing and maintaining a regular study system.<br>
    The course has weekly assignments that are included in the online self-paced presentation you are reading
    now.<br>
    This course is a flipped course, you should go over the online material and finish the assignments BEFORE
    the weekly online meeting.<br>
    Some of these assignments are simply designed for me to assess the level you understood the material
    communicated in the online content.<br>
    However, most of the assignments are a stepping stone to more complex parts to follow.<br>
    Therefore, completing all assignments is key to the successful flow of the course.<br>
    You are not only free to collaborate with your fellow students, but I also encourage you to do so.<br>
    I believe that the best way to learn something in-depth is to successfully teach it to someone else.<br>
    Having said that you will find that the course is designed in a way that assignments are personalized.</p>
<p>GOOGLE is your friend!!!<br>
    I canâ€™t stress this enough, you are in your very first steps in what I hope will become a fruitful
    career.<br>
    However, you will soon find that in most cases, the technical, programmatic and even theoretical problems
    you encounter are not unique. Learn from other people experience.</p>
<p>Know when to give up and ask for help!<br>
    If you searched online for more than 15 minutes and no result is relevant, you are probably asking the wrong
    question.<br>
    If you tried to solve a problem using online knowledge for more than an hour and noting works - STOP!<br>
    In both cases, it might be helpful to ask a friend. Luckily enough we have a TA for the course., Pat has
    agreed to be the TA for the course, and his favourite channel is your slack group - use it.<br>
    If you have general questions (of any kind) send them to my mail, and I will either address them in the
    online meeting or respond directly to you.</p>
<p>As you know, the course also has a blackboard site which you can go to by clicking on the home button the
    left-hand corner of the page.<br>
    Please give feedback on how to improve the course, it will benefit you immediately.</p>
<p>Thank you and good luck</p>
<p>Eyal</p>
