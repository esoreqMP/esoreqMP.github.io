        <h3>
            <p>Welcome to Artificial Intelligence &amp; Intelligent Systems.</p>
        </h3>
        <p>My name is Dr Eyal Soreq, and I am your instructor in this course.<br>
            This course will provide you with applied knowledge of central methods in modern data science and how to use
            them to address neurocognitive questions correctly.
            It will also teach you how to use the GWDG cluster, a skill that is becoming crucial as data-sets become
            larger and more complex.
            And hopefully, this course will also provide you with a strong foundation in how to conduct reproducible
            neurocognitive research.</p>
        <h4>Advice on benefiting the most from the course</h4>
        <p>In addition to welcoming you to the course, I would like to give you some helpful information and a few hints
            for successful completion of this course.
            By now you should be very experienced with online courses.
            As I see it, online courses provide a different way to study and require different skills from students.
            You will find that, as an online learner, self-motivation and discipline are paramount.
            This means that you are entirely responsible for establishing and maintaining a regular study system.
            We have weekly assignments that are included in the online self-paced presentation you are reading
            now. Furthermore, this course is a flipped course, you should go over the online material and finish the assignments BEFORE
            the weekly online meeting.
            Some of these assignments are simply designed for me to assess the level you understood the material
            communicated in the online content.
            However, most of the assignments are a stepping stone to more complex parts to follow.
            </p>
        <h4>Collaborate and share ideas, code, examples etc.</h4>
        <p> Completing all assignments is key to the successful flow of the course.
            You are not only free to collaborate with your fellow students, but I also encourage you to do so.
            I believe that the best way to learn something in-depth is to successfully teach it to someone else.
            Having said that you will find that the course is designed in a way that assignments are personalized.</p>
        <h4>Ask questions!</h4>
            <h5>GOOGLE is your friend!!!</h5>
         <p> I canâ€™t stress this enough, you are in your very first steps in what I hope will become a fruitful
            career.
            However, you will soon find that in most cases, the technical, programmatic and even theoretical problems
            you encounter are not unique. Learn from other people experience.</p>
        <h5>Know when to give up and ask for help!</h5>
         <p> If you searched online for more than 15 minutes and no result is relevant, you are probably asking the
             wrong
            question.
            If you tried to solve a problem using online knowledge for more than an hour and noting works - STOP!
            In both cases, it might be helpful to ask a friend. </p>
        
        <h4>Use our TA!</h4>
            <p> Luckily enough we have a TA for the course, Pat has
            agreed to be the TA for the course, and his favourite channel is your slack group - use it.
            If you have general questions (of any kind) send them to my mail, and I will either address them in the
            online meeting or respond directly to you.</p>
        <h4>Feedback - yes please!!!</h4>
        <p>As you know, the course also has a blackboard site which you can go to by clicking on the home button the
            left-hand corner of the page.
            Please give feedback on how to improve the course, it will benefit you immediately.</p>
        <p>Thank you and good luck</p>
        <p>Eyal</p>
