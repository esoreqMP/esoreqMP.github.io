# Collaborating with version control 

- In this section we will cover how we are going to use git in the course 
- Which is not only for the sake of our course but is something you could adapt for any project you are collaborating on
- We will learn how to fork-and-branch a repository 
- We will learn how to merge our repository with the master branch 
- And finally we will have a small home assignment

## Can anybody push files to my repository on github?

- Nobody can push directly to your repository if you are not already granting them write access
- This is true even if your repository isn't private 
- A private repository simply means that only approved users can see on-line content 
- The process for contributing to a public repository in GitHub starts by forking the repository
- Then pushing the change onto the forked, then creating a pull request onto the original repository 

--- 

## The Fork-and-Branch in detail 

- Fork a GitHub repository
- Forking simply means making a copy of a repository, but maintaining a link to the original remote
- Doing this in the command line is too messy to bother 
- Please go to https://github.com/esoreqMP/MaxPlanck_SystemsAI_2020

## Now lets clone the course repository 



- In the next section you will learn how to create Bash functions 
- The idea is to use simple programing to chain together multiple commands 
- This is one of the most powerful aspects of Bash 
- This is also an essential step in automation
